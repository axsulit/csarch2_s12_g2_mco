# Decimal32 Floating Point Converter
This Python-based Web Application is the implementation of the IEEE Decimal-32 Floating Point standard, in which the input is a decimal, and the output is its binary and hex equivalent. The project is able to handle all normal and special cases. This project uses the HoloViz Panels library for its GUI, which is eventually deployed on Hugging Face.
